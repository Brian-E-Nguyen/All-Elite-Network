# All Elite Network

## Background

All Elite Wrestling (AEW) is an American wrestling company based in Jacksonville, Florida. Since its inception in 2019, AEW has changed the landscape of professional wrestling. It provided a great alternative for new and old wrestling fans, and is considered the second largest professional wrestling company behind Word Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

## Purpose

For years, fans have been wanting a streaming service that provides convenient access to live shows and archived content; this includes AEW's quarterly Pay-Per Views, weekly TV shows (Dynamite and Rampage), and weekly YouTube shows (Dark and Dark Elevation)

The All Elite Network is the ultimate _unofficial_ streaming service for fans of All Elite Wrestling to access the AEW library of amazing content

This application is a mockup UI design for what the application would look like if it were to exist.

## Tech Stack

- React JS
- Sass

## Future Plans

- Login module
- YouTube API to embed Dark / Dark Elevation videos rather than using hard-coded data
