## Background

All Elite Wrestling (AEW) is an American wrestling company based in Jacksonville, Florida. Since its inception in 2019, AEW has changed the landscape of professional wrestling. It provided a great alternative for new and old wrestling fans, and is considered the second largest professional wrestling company behind Word Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

## Purpose

The All Elite Network is the ultimate _unofficial_ streaming service for fans of All Elite Wrestling to access the AEW library of amazing content
